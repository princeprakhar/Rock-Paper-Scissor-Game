This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below are the files included in this repository:
## Files:

## How to Play:
- Open the index.html file in your web browser.
- Click on one of the options: 
    `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissor`
- The computer will randomly select an option.
- The result will be displayed in an alert box - indicating whether you win, lose, or tie.
## JavaScript Logic:
- The game logic is implemented in script.js.
- Each time a player selects an option, a random choice is made for the computer.
- The result is then determined based on the rules of - Rock-Paper-Scissor.
- The score (wins, losses, ties) is stored in the local storage.

## CSS Styling:
- The styling for the game interface is defined in style.css.
- It includes styling for buttons, images, and text elements.
## Note:
